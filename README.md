# Gym-LandigPage

## Introduction


Welcome to my landing page for a new gym! Designed to showcase the gym's offerings, 
EvoGym provides an overview of the available classes, benefits for fitness enthusiasts, and an easy way to contact the gym team. 

This landing page serves as an initial step towards building a comprehensive gym app. 
In the future, I plan to incorporate authentication and user accounts, allowing users to track their workouts and progress towards their fitness goals.
This project was my first build utilizing TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. 
I'm proud to present a powerful and visually appealing app that combines the benefits of static typing and a utility-first CSS framework.
